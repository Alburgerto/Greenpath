Greenpath is a game about completing a recipe book while enjoying the quietness and beauty of nature. Cook delicious food and teas with harvested ingredients from the wild or take in the sights while chilling in the forest.

This game is being developed in Unity3D for my Bachelor's Final Thesis (Computer Science @ Universidad Polit√©cnica de Madrid)
